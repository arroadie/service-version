# Service Version

This project is a quick solution for when you have to keep the versions you have deployed from your service somewhere.

In case you need to integrate a deployment tool that doesn't keep state or just to know when your service was last deployed.

State is stored in a file wherever you run the binary

## Installation

[requires go](https://golang.org/)

Clone the repo and build with
 [go build](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/)

Or just download the compiled binary for mac or linux in the bin folder (no windows yet, so _contribute_)

## Contribution

Fork, code, push, PR :)
